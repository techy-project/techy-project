# Hello!
I am Techy Project. I make projects!
# What am I currently working on?
## FanISO (FISO)
FanISO includes my own community ISOs. It includes:
- Core Plus Pure64 (Core Plus with UEFI support)
- AlmaLinux KDE Spin
- And more!

> Note: FanISO contains unofficial ISOs that are rebuilt using `mkisofs`.
