# Hello!
I am Techy Project. I make projects! I am the free and open-source software developer. I code in:
- C/C++
- Python
- JavaScript (with Node.js, used with my site)
- HTML and CSS (also used in my site)
- Assembly
- And more!
# Current projects
I only have **Cheesebox**.
# Discontinued projects
- Cubuntu (discontinued in mid-2023 after the name of the distro **already existed**, made in 2022)
  - Zacko Linux/ZL (**never released and failed to build**, made in 2023 that was supposed to be a successor for Cubuntu)
- Old2Mod (I am bored making this, made in 2024)
  - OldTOModern (predecessor for Old2Mod, didn't have a source code, made in 2024)
- Cubuntu Projects
  - Cubuntu Builder (supposed to be better than Remastersys but I did not have time to do this because back then I don't know how to make this, made in 2022, has a terminal variant but it is a fork of Linux Live Kit)
  - Cubuntu Boot Screen (Plymouth theme for Cubuntu, made in 2022)
  - CZDE Classic Desktop (supposed to be a desktop environment for Cubuntu but still not because I did not learn how to make it from scratch, made in 2022)
